# My Solutions for Project Euler

These are my solutions to the first 100 problems of [Project Euler](projecteuler.net).
These solutions are all written in C. These are by no means the best or quickest
solutions; if a very simple brute-force solution can be run in a reasonable
amount of time then I will use that solution. I intend this repository
to be mainly a place for me to practice writing C code and an exercise in Git.

## Compiling

The solutions to the individual problems all have their own directory.
Every directory contains a PROBLEM file which is a copy of the problem as
described on Project Euler. Every directory also contains a Makefile to build
the solution and the source files and if applicable the input files for the
solution. A solution can be built while in its directory with ``make`` and
the resulting files can be removed again with ``make clean``.

## Contributing

I am always looking to learn! If you have a smarter or better solution to a
problem feel free to share it with me via a pull request.
